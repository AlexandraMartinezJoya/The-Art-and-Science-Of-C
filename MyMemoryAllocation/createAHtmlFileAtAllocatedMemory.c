//Here we need to declare a variable. and assign it it a binary value.
//Next we need to print the stack trace where it saved.
//Here we need to declare a second variable, and assign it a secondary binary value
//Next we need to print again the stack trace of where it saves
//Then we need to assign the second varibale the next sequence of the stack trace of the first variable.
//To try: naming the variables directly in binary. then assign the value of hexadecimal
//to try: naming the variables in hexadecimal and then assigning them the value in decimal
